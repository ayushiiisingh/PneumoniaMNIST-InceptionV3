## Hyperparameters

| Hyperparameter    | Value  |
|-------------------|--------|
| Learning Rate     | 0.0001 |
| Batch Size        | 32     |
| Epochs            | 20     |
| Optimizer         | Adam   |
| Loss Function     | Binary Crossentropy |

These values were chosen based on common transfer learning practices. The learning rate was kept low (0.0001) to ensure stable fine-tuning of the pre-trained InceptionV3 layers. A batch size of 32 and 20 epochs provided a good trade-off between training time and performance.
